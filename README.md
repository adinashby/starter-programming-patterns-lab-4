# Programming Patterns - Lab 2

This template repository is the starter project for Programming Patterns Lab 2. Written in Java, and tested with Gradle/JUnit.

### Question(s)

For the following questions, only use Lambdas and Streams.

1. Write a method that returns the average of a list of integers.
2. Write a method that converts all strings in a list to their upper case.
3. Given a list of strings, write a method that returns a list of all strings that start with the letter 'a' (lower case) and have exactly 3 letters.
4. Write a method that returns a comma-separated string based on a given list of integers. Each element should be preceded by the letter 'e' if the number is even, and preceded by the letter 'o' if the number is odd. For example, if the input list is (3,44), the output should be 'o3,e44'.
